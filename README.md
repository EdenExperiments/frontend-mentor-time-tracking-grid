# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local `data.json` file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the `.html` file.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Expected behaviour

- The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".

## Review

I managed to take away a lot on how CSS grid works on this project, alongside it is my first time working with JSON on a project and also local storage (I added in that it saves your most recent toggle selection in local storage and runs it on page load). It was difficult to first get to grips with the layout, and my CSS could be improved. 

I would add in an in-between design of two columns (even though the figma only provides the two designs seen in the product), and also I could improve the userName card in terms of appearance. However, I am proud of completing this project and looking forward to doing a calculator next to improve my CSS grid alongside some additional functionality.
